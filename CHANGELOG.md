# 0.7.0 (PENDING)

- Major updates to theme features
  - Update: now supports the Obsidian 1.0 themes architecture change (no longer using obsidian.css, rather using theme.css & manifest.json)
  - Change: When deleting a theme from within BRAT's settings, the theme is removed from BRAT monitoring, but the theme is not physically deleted from the vault. 
  - Removed: the ability to "switch themes" is removed as this feature was sherlocked and natively added to Obsidian in the command palette with the "Change Theme" command

# Grab a beta theme from a repository
BRAT helps you to test themes currently under development. To use this feature:

1. Open the command palette and select the command **Grab a beta theme for testing from a Github repository**
2. You are then prompted for the url path to the github repository where the theme is stored

BRAT will then validate that a theme exists, download it and switch your current theme to this beta theme.

Since this is a beta theme and does not yet have a community name,  BRAT assigns it a unique name using "BRAT-" in the beginning and adding the name of the Github user and repository.

# Updata a beta theme from a repository
Using the theme update command, Brat will check  for all beta themese and see if there  is an update.  If there is an update, it downloads the update and notifies you.

# Grab a community theme
While BRAT is designed for testing themes, you can still install a theme already published to the community. This theme wil not be updated with the BRAT update feature.

# Switch Active Theme
Switch quickly between any installed theme, whether it is a beta theme you installed from a repository or a theme from the community list.

# Settings for themes
In settings for BRAT, you can delete any registered beta themes.
